    <!-- TEXT -->

    <p class="citation">AB ENGINEERING, a design office specializing in structure, fluid and electricity,
        is involved in all stages of the cycle of a civil engineering project, from its
        preliminary design, identifying its requirements and constraints, up to the complete
        delivery of the work. Customer-Partner satisfaction is our primary goal.</p>

    <!-- SPECIALITIES -->

    <div class="box">Structures and infrastructure construction require extensive knowledge of structural engineering,
        VRD and infrastructure. Our engineers and technicians constantly deepen their knowledge in this field to offer
        our customers innovative processes.

        Our project management and building economics department is experienced in conducting complex missions. From the
        definition of the project to its delivery, we master all the design stages to make a project a real success.

        Our knowledge of the different types of terrain, structures and different building materials allows us to
        guarantee services that meet your requirements.

        An environmental charter guides all our actions, particularly in terms of respect for local fauna and flora,
        limiting the production of waste and reducing water and energy consumption. We also focus our choices on the use
        of renewable energy where possible.
